This is a Spring based project for an Order Management System implemented in the form of microservices.
<br/>
A user can register itself, login, create orders, update orders and get list of his created orders.
<br/>
There are 4 different microservices operating together namely Inventory-Service, Order-Service, User-Order-Service and Account-Service.
<br/>
For Service Registry and Discovery, I have used Eureka Server.
